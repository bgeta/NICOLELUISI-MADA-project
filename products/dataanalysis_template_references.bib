abstract = {Purpose: In the United States, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)/acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) disproportionately impacts racial/ethnic minorities. We describe and evaluate trends in the Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities of new AIDS diagnoses from 1984 to 2013 in the United States. Methods: AIDS diagnosis rates by race/ethnicity for people ≥13 years were calculated using national HIV surveillance and Census data. Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities were measured as rate ratios. Joinpoint Regression was used to identify time periods across which to estimate rate-ratio trends. We calculated the estimated annual percent change in disparities for each time period using log-normal linear regression modeling. Results: Black-White disparity increased from 1984 to 1990, followed by a large increase from 1991 to 1996, and a smaller increase from 1997 to 2001. Black-White disparity moderated from 2002 to 2005 and rose again from 2006 to 2013. Hispanic-White disparity increased from 1984 to 1997 but declined after 1998. Black-White and Hispanic-White disparities increased for men who have sex with men during 2008 to 2013. Conclusions: Recent increases in racial/ethnic disparities of AIDS diagnoses were observed and may be due in part to care continuum inequalities. We suggest assessing disparities in AIDS diagnoses as a high-level measure to capture changes at multiple stages of the care continuum collectively. Future research should examine determinants of racial/ethnic differences at each step of the continuum to better identify characteristics driving disparities.}

  abstract = {Background: AIDSVu is a public resource for visualizing HIV surveillance data and other population-based information relevant to HIV prevention, care, policy, and impact assessment. Objective: The site, AIDSVu.org, aims to make data about the US HIV epidemic widely available, easily accessible, and locally relevant to inform public health decision making. Methods: AIDSVu develops visualizations, maps, and downloadable datasets using results from HIV surveillance systems, other population-based sources of information (eg, US Census and national probability surveys), and other data developed specifically for display and dissemination through the website (eg, pre-exposure prophylaxis [PrEP] prescriptions). Other types of content are developed to translate surveillance data into summarized content for diverse audiences using infographic panels, interactive maps, local and state fact sheets, and narrative blog posts. Results: Over 10 years, AIDSVu.org has used an expanded number of data sources and has progressively provided HIV surveillance and related data at finer geographic levels, with current data resources providing HIV prevalence data down to the census tract level in many of the largest US cities. Data are available at the county level in 48 US states and at the ZIP Code level in more than 50 US cities. In 2019, over 500,000 unique users consumed AIDSVu data and resources, and HIV-related data and insights were disseminated through nearly 4,000,000 social media posts. Since AIDSVu's inception, at least 249 peer-reviewed publications have used AIDSVu data for analyses or referenced AIDSVu resources. Data uses have included targeting of HIV testing programs, identifying areas with inequitable PrEP uptake, including maps and data in academic and community grant applications, and strategically selecting locations for new HIV treatment and care facilities to serve high-need areas. Conclusions: Surveillance data should be actively used to guide and evaluate public health programs; AIDSVu translates high-quality, population-based data about the US HIV epidemic and makes that information available in formats that are not consistently available in surveillance reports. Bringing public health surveillance data to an online resource is a democratization of data, and presenting information about the HIV epidemic in more visual formats allows diverse stakeholders to engage with, understand, and use these important public health data to inform public health decision making.},

abstract = {Purpose: Pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with oral emtricitibine/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF/FTC) reduces the risk of HIV infection by >90% when taken as prescribed. Trends in prevalence of PrEP use, which account for persons who have stopped PrEP, increased through 2016, but have not been described since. Methods: Annual prevalence estimates of unique, TDF/FTC PrEP users (individuals with ≥1 day of a filled PrEP prescription in a given year) in the United States (US) were generated for 2012–2017 from a national prescription database. A validated algorithm was used to distinguish users of TDF/FTC for HIV or chronic Hepatitis B treatment or postexposure prophylaxis from PrEP users. We calculated annual prevalence of PrEP use overall and by age, sex, and region. We used log-transformation to calculate estimated annual percent change (EAPC) in the prevalence of PrEP use. Results: Annual prevalence of PrEP use increased from 3.3/100,000 population in 2012 to 36.7 in 2017 –a 56% annual increase from 2012 to 2017 (EAPC:+56%). Annual prevalence of PrEP use increased faster among men than among women (EAPC:+68% and+5%, respectively). By age group, annual prevalence of PrEP use increased fastest among 25- to 34-year olds (EAPC:+61%) and slowest among ≥55-year olds (EAPC:+52%) and ≤24-year olds (EAPC:+51%). In 2017, PrEP use was lowest in the South (29.8/100,000) and highest in the Northeast (62.3/100,000). Conclusions: Despite overall increases in the annual number of TDF/FTC PrEP users in the US from 2012 to 2017, the growth of PrEP coverage is inconsistent across groups. Efforts to optimize PrEP access are especially needed for women and for those living in the South.}

abstract = {Background:A large and growing body of “big data” is generated by internet search engines, such as Google. Because people often search for information about public health and medical issues, researchers may be able to use search engine data to monitor and predict public health problems, such as HIV. We sought to assess the feasibility of using Google search data to analyze and predict new HIV diagnoses cases in the United States. Methods and findings: From 2007 to 2014, we collected search volume data on HIV-related Google search keywords across the United States. State-level new HIV diagnoses data were collected from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and AIDSVu.org. We developed a negative binomial model to predict HIV cases using a subset of significant predictor keywords identified by LASSO. The Google search data were combined with state-level HIV case reports provided by the CDC. We use historical data to train the model and predict new HIV diagnoses from 2011 to 2014, with an average R2 value of 0.99 between predicted versus actual cases, and average root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 108.75. Conclusions: Results indicate that Google Trends is a feasible tool to predict new cases of HIV at the state level. We discuss the implications of integrating visualization maps and tools based on these models into public health and HIV monitoring and surveillance.}

abstract = {Background: During 2008–2015, the estimated annual HIV incidence rate in the United States decreased for each transmission risk category, except for men who have sex with men (MSM). Racial/ethnic disparities exist, with higher incidence rates for Black and Hispanic/Latino MSM. Setting: This analysis examines changes, 2010–2015, in disparities of HIV incidence among Black, Hispanic/Latino and White MSM. Methods: We compared results from the rate ratio, rate difference, weighted and unweighted index of disparity, and population attributable proportion. We calculated incidence rates for MSM using HIV surveillance data and published estimates of the MSM population in the United States. We generated 95% confidence intervals for each measure and used the Z statistic and associated P values to assess statistical significance. Findings: Results from all but one measure, Black-to-White rate difference, indicate that racial/ethnic disparities increased during 2010–2015; not all results were statistically significant. There were statistically significant increases in the Hispanic/Latino-to-White MSM incidence rate ratio (29%, P < 0.05), weighted index of disparity with the rate for White MSM as the referent group (9%, P < 0.05), and the population attributable proportion index (10%, P < 0.05). If racial/ethnic disparities among MSM had been eliminated, a range of 55%–61% decrease in overall MSM HIV incidence would have been achieved during 2010–2015. Conclusions: A large reduction in overall annual HIV incidence among MSM can be achieved by eliminating racial/ethnic disparities among MSM. Removing social and structural causes of racial/ethnic disparities among MSM can be effective in reducing overall annual HIV incidence among MSM.}

abstract = {The first cases of Pneumocystis carinii (jirovecii) pneumonia among young men, which were subsequently linked to HIV infection, were reported in the MMWR on June 5, 1981 (1). At year-end 2019, an estimated 1.2 million persons in the United States were living with HIV infection (2). Using data reported to the National HIV Surveillance System, CDC estimated the annual number of new HIV infections (incidence) among persons aged ≥13 years in the United States during 1981–2019. Estimated annual HIV incidence increased from 20,000 infections in 1981 to a peak of 130,400 infections in 1984 and 1985. Incidence was relatively stable during 1991–2007, with approximately 50,000–58,000 infections annually, and then decreased in recent years to 34,800 infections in 2019. The majority of infections continue to be attributable to male-to-male sexual contact (63% in 1981 and 66% in 2019). Over time, the proportion of HIV infections has increased among Black/African American (Black) persons (from 29% in 1981 to 41% in 2019) and among Hispanic/Latino persons (from 16% in 1981 to 29% in 2019). Despite the lack of a cure or a vaccine, today’s HIV prevention tools, including HIV testing, prompt and sustained treatment, preexposure prophylaxis, and comprehensive syringe service programs, provide an opportunity to substantially decrease new HIV infections. Intensifying efforts to implement these strategies equitably could accelerate declines in HIV transmission, morbidity, and mortality and reduce disparities.}
