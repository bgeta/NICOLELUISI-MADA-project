About the Folders:

The sub-folder `code` contains script files to clean, process, and analyze data.

source data downloaded from AIDSVu (sub-folder `AIDSVu`). Subfolders within the `AIDSVu` folder are separated by geographic area (`National/NewDx`, `Region/NewDx`, `State/NewDx`). Note that state-level analyses are not included in this project but keeping these files handy for later. 

The sub-folder `data` contains raw source data and any other processed data files. 

The sub-folder `products` contains the manuscript and other materials. At this time (project Part 3) most of these files are not yet in use, with the exception of the Quarto manuscript file. 

The sub-folder `results` contains any output files from the analysis for tables, figures, etc.
