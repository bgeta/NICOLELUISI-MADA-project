About the Folder:

Sub-folder `AIDSVu` contains source data downloaded from AIDSVu (sub-folder `AIDSVu`). Subfolders within the `AIDSVu` folder are separated by geographic area (`National/NewDx`, `Region/NewDx`, `State/NewDx`). Note that state-level analyses are not included in this project but keeping these files handy for later. 

These files contain new diagnosis rate data (rate per 100,000). All headers in the raw files are self-explanatory (rates for overall, sex, age group, race/ethnicity). Detailed computation and other methods are available at https://aidsvu.org/data-methods/data-methods-statecounty/.
